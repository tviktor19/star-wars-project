# star-wars-project
A React-based single-page application built during a **frontend bootcamp** challenge. 
The task was to recreate a given **Figma design** and build a complete React project using **Redux**, **Router**, **Breadcrumbs**, and a **local JSON database** as the data source.

---

This repository was part of a bootcamp assignment.

## 🚀 Project Overview

The **Star Wars Explorer** allows users to browse and explore information about characters, planets, species, vehicles, and starships from a local JSON database.  
It demonstrates the use of **Redux for global state management**, **React Router for navigation**, and **Breadcrumbs** for hierarchical user navigation — all styled based on a provided **Figma design**.

## ✨ Features

- 🔹 **Data fetching** from a local `db.json` file via JSON Server  
- 🔹 **Dynamic routing** with React Router  
- 🔹 **Breadcrumb navigation** showing current location  
- 🔹 **Reusable UI components** for lists and detail pages  
- 🔹 **Global state management** using Redux Toolkit  
- 🔹 **Loading and error handling** states  
- 🔹 **Responsive design** matching Figma layout  
- 🔹 **Code quality tools:** ESLint, Prettier, Husky
